## 4. Hot reload vs hot restart
Work scope: Leanred more about stateless widgets and concept of hot reload which is an edge for flutter

`Performing hot reload...
Syncing files to device iPhone 14 Pro Max...
Reloaded 1 of 665 libraries in 250ms (compile: 81 ms, reload: 105 ms, reassemble: 47 ms).`

## 5. Single-child layout widgets
