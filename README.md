## 4. Hot reload vs hot restart
Work: Leanred more about stateless widgets and concept of hot reload which is an edge for flutter

`Performing hot reload...
Syncing files to device iPhone 14 Pro Max...
Reloaded 1 of 665 libraries in 250ms (compile: 81 ms, reload: 105 ms, reassemble: 47 ms).`

## 5. Single-child layout widgets
Work: Learned more about containers and how its size is decided given the different factors (child, margin, padding and safe area). One can also choose a specific width and height.

## 6. Multiple-children layout widgets
Work: Explored columns and rows. SizedBox. CrossAxisAligment. MainAxisAlignment.
